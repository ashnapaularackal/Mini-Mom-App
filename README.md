Mini Mom App: A Virtual Mom for Those Far from Home

For many who miss their mom and are far from home, daily life can feel challenging without her comforting presence. The Mini Mom App acts as a caring companion, offering personalized reminders, weather updates, and traffic alerts to help users manage tasks with a sense of maternal care.

How It Works
Developed for the Gemini API Developer Competition, the app leverages the Gemini API to provide thoughtful advice that mimics a mother’s nurturing guidance. For regular destinations like school, office, or the gym, Mini Mom uses the user’s current location, just as a mom would naturally know. For less frequent destinations like a party or interview, the app prompts the user for the location to deliver tailored reminders, weather updates, and traffic information.

Setup Instructions
To get started, add the line GEMINI_API_KEY=yourkey to your .env file.

The Mini Mom App bridges the emotional gap for those far from home, offering practical support and comfort, making users feel closer to their loved ones.
